	Include a brief (300-500 words) report on
	(0.5) Your Group development journey during this project. Focus on aspects you find noteworthy, e.g., process, pairing, testing, design decisions, refactoring, use of the repository.
	(0.5) The relationship between your extended state machine model from this project and your actual code. Possible talking points are:
	What are the similarities and differences between model and code?
	Is it more effective to code or model first?
	Now that you have code, what, if any, changes would you make to your model?




I think it is more effective to code first as you can use it to validate what you want to do rather than
working off of your model without any sort of validation. The model also may not be an accurate representation of the code
that was coded making the model useless for others to learn your code. But if you were to code first then shape your model
based on what works for your code, it can become a useful tool for your teammates and other programmers who may take over
your code.
